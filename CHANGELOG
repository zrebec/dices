# CHANGELOG

## TODO
[ ] Add "Loose!" title if totalRollCountLimit is reached without any winning condition.
[ ] Make a flashing titlebar function with one input parameter (newText) and call it when you win or when totalRollCountLimit is reached without any winning condition.
[ ] Make the stopwatch text bigger, centered, and repositioned.

## Potential Logical Problems in script.js
[ ] Ensure that the winning condition is correctly defined and checked.
[ ] Verify that the totalRollCountLimit is properly incremented and compared.
[ ] Check that the flashing titlebar function is called in all appropriate scenarios.
[ ] Confirm that the stopwatch text updates correctly and is displayed in the intended position.
[ ] Validate that all game states (win, lose, ongoing) are handled appropriately.
[ ] Ensure that there are no infinite loops or conditions that could cause the game to hang.

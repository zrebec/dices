# CHANGELOG

## TODO List
- [ ] Add "Loose!" title if totalRollCountLimit is reached without any winning condition.
- [ ] Create a function to make the titlebar flash with a new text.
- [ ] Call the flashing titlebar function when the player wins or when totalRollCountLimit is reached without any winning condition.
- [ ] Make the stopwatch text bigger, centered, and reposition it.
